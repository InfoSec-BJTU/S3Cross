# Overvoew

We use the [\[cpsnark-set\]](https://github.com/kobigurk/cpsnarks-set) library for public identity proof.

# Usage

The following commands assume you have a nightly Rust toolchain installed, e.g. 1.73.0. The Bulletproofs implementation also requires a nightly toolchain.

To run the tests for the proof, run `cargo run`.
